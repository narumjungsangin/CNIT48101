            TODO (1 pt): Provide a header to your web page. 
            1. Use the highest level heading to present the page title (E.g. Your Name).
            2. Use a paragraph to showcase how you position yourself on the job market. E.g. your professional title, domain, accomplishments, etc.

         <!-- Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate. -->

            TODO (2 pts): Create an unordered list of the key section name of your resume. For example:
            - Profile Summary
            - Work Experience
            - Educaiton
            - Skill
            - ...
